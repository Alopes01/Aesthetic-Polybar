![here](screenshots/instaler.png)

- This script will install fonts and copy the polybar configs to the ``.config`` folder, if you have any polybar configs there the script will make a backup of them.

- After that, you can select the options that you'd like to test and the script will output them for you.

## Testing bars multiple times 

You can't run the installer script multiple times, so there is a script to do it :

```sh
./test.sh
```

## Dont forget to:
Set the polybar to execute on startup ``polybar -c $HOME/.config/polybar/(theme)/(COLOR).ini``  (copy this line and set it to execute on start up)

## What this repo doesn't contain ‚ùå
- Rofi powermenu and wifimenu scripts, I recommend [these](https://github.com/adi1090x/rofi)

- Custom Wallpaper support, but if this repo reaches to 60 stars ‚≠êÔ∏è, this month there will be a survey in the issues where you will post your favourite wallpaper. The 10 most popular ones will get a custom colored polybar .

## Example of custom wallpapers

Please i'm a human if you find any errors report them in the issues section

- If the temperature module doesn't work try, changing to your grafics card in the polybar config.
- For those who want to use the dark green color the name of the config is green-dark.ini.
